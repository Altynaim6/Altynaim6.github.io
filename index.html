            <h2><b>Altynai Munduzbaeva COMSEP-23</b></h2> 
            <p>I come from Jalal-Abad. My hometown is called Shamaldy - Sai<br>
            the land of watermelon and a hydroelectric power station. I graduated from School Number 2, which is a Kyrgyz school. 
            I lived there with my family, consisting of six people: my father, mother, two brothers, sister, and myself. 
            I had a wonderful childhood with my family, studied well in school, and had many friends.
            In 2022, I applied to a preparatory school to learn English. It was an unforgettable year where I met a lot of interesting people 
            and had fun with them. Some of them continue to study with me. Currently, I am studying in the Computer Science faculty, 
            which presents challenges, but I'm determined not to give up. Please wish me good luck on my journey!

            <p>One of my hobbies is playing our traditional musical instrument, the komuz. It is truly fascinating how,<br>
            with just three strings, it can produce such a rich array of sounds. Through the komuz, we can express our feelings<br> 
            and share the beauty of our culture. We can take pride in these things, which have been passed down to us by our ancestors<br> 
            and continue to live on as the spirit of our nation
